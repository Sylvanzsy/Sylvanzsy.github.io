	abstract = {We use semi-analytical models to study the effects of primordial black hole (PBH) accretion on the cosmic radiation background during the epoch of reionization (\$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 6\$). We consider PBHs floating in the intergalactic medium (IGM), and located inside haloes, where star formation can occur. For stars with a mass \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 25 {\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, formed in suitable host haloes, we assume they quickly burn out and form stellar remnant black holes (SRBHs). Since SRBHs also accrete material from their surroundings, we consider them to have similar radiation feedback as PBHs in the halo environment. To estimate the background radiation level more accurately, we take into account the impact of PBHs on structure formation, allowing an improved modeling of the halo mass function. We consider the radiation feedback from a broad suite of black holes: PBHs, SRBHs, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We find that at \$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 30\$, the radiation background energy density is generated by PBHs accreting in the IGM, whereas at lower redshifts, the accretion feedback power from haloes dominates. We also analyze the total power density by modeling the accretion spectral energy distribution (SED), and break it down into select wavebands. In the UV band, we find that for \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm PBH\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, the H-ionizing and Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ fluxes from PBH accretion feedback do not violate existing constraints on the timing of reionization, and on the effective Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the 21-cm spin temperature of neutral hydrogen to the kinetic temperature of the IGM. However, in the X-ray band, with the same abundance, PBHs contribute significantly and could account for the unresolved part of the cosmic X-ray background.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11606},
	abstract = {The first bright objects to form in the Universe at redshift \$z {\textbackslash}sim 10-20\$ might have been Dark Stars, made primarily of hydrogen and helium but powered by dark matter. In this study, we investigate the detectability of Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDS) by the Roman Space Telescope. RST will be able to detect SMDSs at redshifts as high as \$z{\textbackslash}simeq 14\$. In cases with gravitational lensing factors of \${\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}sim 100\$, RST will be able to find SMDS as small as \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}4 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 12\$ with \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}6\$ s of exposure. To differentiate SMDS from early galaxies containing zero metallicity stars at similar redshifts, we compare their spectra, photometry in RST bands, color indexes and image morphology. With RST alone, the differentiation is possible only for limited cases: SMDS formed via "adiabatic contraction" (DM pulled into the star via gravity alone) with \$M{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}5M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and lensed by \${\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}gtrsim 30\$ have distinct photometric signatures from those of the first galaxies. For SMDSs formed via "dark matter capture," their spectra are degenerate to those of many galaxies with little to no nebular emission. Thus with RST alone, the only way to tell them apart from first galaxies would be via image morphology: i.e. point object (SMDSs) vs. extended object (sufficiently magnified galaxies). However, if the same objects are further examined by JWST spectroscopy, a "smoking gun" for detection of SMDS is the HeII \${\textbackslash}lambda\$1640 absorption line. While RST does not cover the wavelength band required to find this line (for \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm emi\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10\$), JWST does. Hence the two detectors can be used together in identifying SMDS. The confirmed detection of any SMDSs will provide evidence for a new type of star, powered by dark matter. Moreover, such massive stars can also be natural progenitors of the supermassive black holes powering the extremely bright quasars observed at \$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 6\$.},

	abstract = {We use cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations and semi-analytical models to study the effects of primordial black holes (PBHs) on first star formation. Our models self-consistently combine two competing effects: initial (isocurvature) perturbations induced by PBHs and BH accretion feedback. Focusing on PBHs with masses \${\textbackslash}sim 30{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, we find that the standard picture of first star formation in molecular-cooling minihaloes is not changed by PBHs, as the simulated star-forming gas clouds in the central parsec are very similar to those in the \${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}Lambda CDM\$ case when PBHs make up fPBH ∼ 10−4−0.1 of dark matter. With a dynamical friction time-scale of \${\textbackslash}sim 2\{{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!\}10{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm Myr\$ when the central gas density reaches \$10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, it is also unlikely that PBHs can sink into star-forming discs and affect the evolution of protostars, although they may interact with the stars during the main-sequence stage. At larger scales, PBHs tend to shift star formation to more massive haloes and accelerate structure formation. The latter effect is stronger in regions with higher initial overdensities. For fPBH ∼ 10−4−0.01 (allowed by observational constraints), the collapsed mass fraction of haloes hosting Population III stars is similar (within a factor of ∼2 at z ≲ 30) to that in \${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}Lambda CDM\$, implying that the impact of stellar-mass PBHs on the cosmic star formation history at z ≳ 10 is small. We also find that the Lyman–Werner photons from PBH accretion in atomic-cooling haloes may facilitate the formation of direct-collapse BHs.},
