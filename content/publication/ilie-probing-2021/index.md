abstract: 'We show that the mere observation of the first stars (Pop III stars) in
  the universe can be used to place tight constraints on the strength of the interaction
  between dark matter and regular, baryonic matter. We apply this technique to a candidate
  Pop III stellar complex discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope at $z sim 7$
  and find bounds that are competitive with, or even stronger than, current direct
  detection experiments, such as XENON1T, for dark matter particles with mass ($m_X$)
  larger than about $100$ GeV. We also show that the discovery of sufficiently massive
  Pop III stars could be used to bypass the main limitations of direct detection experiments:
  the neutrino background to which they will be soon sensitive.'
