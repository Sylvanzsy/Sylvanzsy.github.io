# abstract: We semi-analytically model the effects of primordial black hole (PBH) accretion on the cosmic radiation background during the epoch of reionization (z larger than 6). PBHs in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes, where star formation can occur, are considered. For stars with a mass larger than 25 solar mass, formed in suitable host haloes, we assume they quickly burn out and form stellar remnant black holes (SRBHs). These SRBHs, like PBHs, also accrete material, and are considered to have similar radiation feedback in the halo environment. To improve the background radiation estimation, we consider the impact of PBHs on structure formation, allowing a modified halo mass function. We consider the radiation feedback from a broad suite of black holes: PBHs, SRBHs, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The result shows that at z greater than 30, the radiation background energy density is generated by PBHs accreting in the IGM, whereas at lower redshifts, halo accretion dominates. We also dissect the total power density by modeling the accretion spectral energy distribution (SED) across different wavebands. In the UV band, we find that for PBH fraction in DM less than 1e-3, the H-ionizing and Lyman Alpha fluxes from PBH accretion feedback do not violate existing constraints on the timing of reionization, and on the effective Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the 21-cm spin temperature of neutral hydrogen to the IGM kinetic temperature. However, in the X-ray band, with the same abundance, PBHs contribute significantly and could explain the unresolved part of the cosmic X-ray background.

We use cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations and semi-analytical models to study the effects of primordial black holes (PBHs) on first star formation. Our models self-consistently combine two competing effects: initial (isocurvature) perturbations induced by PBHs and BH accretion feedback. Focusing on PBHs with masses $\sim 30 M_{\odot}$, we find that the standard picture of first star formation in molecular-cooling minihaloes is not changed by PBHs, as the simulated star-forming gas clouds in the central parsec are very similar to those in the $\rm \Lambda CDM$ case when PBHs make up $f_{PBH}\sim 10^{-4}-0.1$ of dark matter. With a dynamical friction timescale of $\sim 2-10\ \rm Myr$ when the central gas density reaches $10^{5} cm^{-3}$, it is also unlikely that PBHs can sink into star-forming discs and affect the evolution of protostars, although they may interact with the stars during the main-sequence stage. At larger scales, PBHs tend to shift star formation to more massive haloes, and accelerate structure formation. The latter effect is stronger in regions with higher initial overdensities. For $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^{-4}-0.01$ (allowed by observational constraints), the collapsed mass fraction of haloes hosting Population~III stars is similar (within a factor of $\sim2$ at $z< 30$) to that in $\rm \Lambda CDM$, implying that the impact of stellar-mass PBHs on the cosmic star formation history at $z> 10$ is small. We also find that the Lyman-Werner photons from PBH accretion in atomic-cooling haloes may facilitate the formation of direct-collapse BHs.
