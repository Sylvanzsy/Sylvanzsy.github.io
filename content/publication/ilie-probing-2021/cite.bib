 abstract = {We show that the mere observation of the first stars (Pop III stars) in the universe can be used to place tight constraints on the strength of the interaction between dark matter and regular, baryonic matter. We apply this technique to a candidate Pop III stellar complex discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope at \$z \sim 7\$ and find bounds that are competitive with, or even stronger than, current direct detection experiments, such as XENON1T, for dark matter particles with mass (\$m_X\$) larger than about \$100\$ GeV. We also show that the discovery of sufficiently massive Pop III stars could be used to bypass the main limitations of direct detection experiments: the neutrino background to which they will be soon sensitive.},
 annote = {Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to PRL; Revised version. Summary of changes done: we included an analysis bounds on the proton-DM scattering cross sections for the CoSIMP sub-GeV thermal dark matter model; we expanded on our discussion of the dark matter densities in the environments in which Pop~III stars form; we present an approximation of the evaporation rate of DM from PopIII stars},
